🚀 Java Redemption Arc
Hey there! 👋

After years of coding in everything but Java, I've decided it's time to RE-learn it from scratch. Yes, I'm basically a Java newbie again. Please be patient. 🤓

🌱 What’s the plan?
✔️ Struggling with syntax I once knew.
✔️ Making dumb mistakes that even ChatGPT will judge me for.
✔️ Writing code that will make future me cringe.
✔️ Eventually creating something epic.

🎯 The end goal?
A freaking awesome project that will make all this pain worth it. 🔥
